1.   get all statuses, not repaeting, alphabeticaly ordered
        SELECT DISTINCT status FROM tasks ORDER BY status ASC
2.   get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
        SELECT project_id, COUNT(*) AS count_all FROM tasks GROUP BY project_id ORDER BY count_all DESC
3.   get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
        SELECT COUNT(tasks.id) AS amoun_of_tasks, projects.name AS project_name FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY project_id ORDER BY projects.name
4.   get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter
        SELECT tasks.name AS task_name, projects.name AS project_name FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE tasks.name LIKE "N%"
5.   get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL
        SELECT projects.name AS project_name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS amount_of_tasks FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE projects.name LIKE "%a%" GROUP BY tasks.project_id
6.   get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
        SELECT COUNT(name) AS amount_of_duplicated_name, name FROM tasks GROUP BY name HAVING amount_of_duplicated_name > 1 ORDER BY name ASC
7.   get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count
        SELECT tasks.name, COUNT(tasks.name) AS amount_of_tasks FROM projects INNER JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE projects.name = 'Garage' GROUP BY tasks.name, tasks.status HAVING amount_of_tasks > 1
8.   get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order by project_id
        SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS amount_of_tasks FROM projects INNER JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE tasks.status = 't' GROUP BY tasks.project_id HAVING amount_of_tasks > 10 ORDER BY tasks.project_id ASC
